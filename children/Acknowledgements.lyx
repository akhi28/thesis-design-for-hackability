Thanks to Teemu Leinonen for finding a position for me to do this research
 in LeGroup, and for reading drafts.
 He and Anna Keune piled my desk with literature, giving me a jumpstart
 on getting perspective on my project within the context of people with
 similar goals through the years.

Jyri Pieniniemi is my Meemoo brain trust.
 He provided the original seed of the idea, and has bounced ideas with me

 He also made the awesome illustration on the cover.
