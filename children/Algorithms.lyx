The Pitch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you think of an "app," do you think of something that you can open,
 hack, and change how it works? Meemoo wants to give you this freedom.
 If you can't open it, you don't own it.
 Meemoo is a framework that connects open-source modules, powered by any
 web technology.
 The way that the data flows from module to module is defined and visualized
 by colorful wires.
 If you can connect a video player to a TV, you can program a Meemoo app.
 Meemoo is:

Persona Profiles and Scenarios

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These profiles were written to have an imaginary person at different levels
 of engagement with the framework.
 They are fictional; any similarity to any person is coincidental.

Cate the Creator 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cate is a nine-year-old girl who lives in the suburbs with her parents and
 thirteen-year-old brother.
 She likes using the video camera in her iPod to create movies starring
 her toys, narrating the story as she makes it up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her brother uses the Internet and Facebook every evening.
 Sometimes he shows her funny animated GIFs and videos that his friends
 link to.
 One of his friends linked to an animated GIF made with LEGO bricks.
 In the description for the animation's page was a link to the Meemoo app
 for stop-motion animation that made it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They click on the link and see a Meemoo app with two modules wired together.
 The first module shows the image from their webcam.
 She clicks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

capture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a still capture jumps to the second module.
 She clicks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

capture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 again and the second module shows a two-frame looping animation of the
 two of them shifting a little bit back-and-forth, looped.
 They laugh at it, because her brother was making a funny face in one of
 the frames.
 They understand how it works now, so they clear the image and start over.
 They make an animation with more frames, making funny faces and jumping
 around the room.
 They save the resulting animated GIF image file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cate decides that it would be fun to make a short story with stop-motion
 animation.
 She gathers some toys and starts to plan the story.

Henry the Hacker 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Henry is Cate's older brother.
 His communication with his friends at school is peppered with references
 to Internet memes and inside jokes.
 He enjoys drawing comic book heroes in his notebooks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After playing with Meemoo with his sister, Henry notices the

 feature.
 He activates it and sees a list of modules that can be added to the app.
 He adds the paint module and sees that it is a simple version of a familiar
 paint application interface.
 He discovers how to add a connections between modules and wires the webcam
 module to the paint module.
 He takes a picture of one of his sister's stuffed animal cats, and then
 paints a helmet on the cat's image.
 He does this a couple more times, amused by the animated loop that he is
 creating.
 He saves the GIF to his desktop and then emails it to a friend.

\begin_layout Section
Molly the Modder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molly is a 28-year-old programmer.
 She has been involved in the demo scene, writing code that pushes computers
 to make complicated real-time graphics.
 She got interested in an on-line challenge to make a demo that runs in
 the web browser using less than four kilobytes of JavaScript.
 Her entry was a flock of polygonal birds that moved around the screen according
 to a flocking algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another entry in the contest made a simple drum synth sequencer.
 Molly thought it would be cool if the her birds could change the direction
 of their flight in rhythm with the drum demo.
 She added a little JavaScript to both demos to make them Meemoo modules
 and wired them together in the framework.
