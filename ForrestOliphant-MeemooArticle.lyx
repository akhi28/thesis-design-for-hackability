\begin_layout Standard
The people that created the vision of the personal computer in the late
 1960s wanted everybody to be able to create their own tools (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Metamedia"

\end_inset

).
 Learning traditional computer programming still takes a major commitment,
 and most people are satisfied with the tools that come with the computer
 or are offered as services online.
 The barrier to entry to learning traditional programming involves setting
 up a programming environment, learning different systems for creating presentat
ion and logic, and learning different programming and markup languages and
 syntaxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People that overcome these barriers to entry are able to create software
 tools for themselves and others.
 People that create tools that are open to modification afford other people
 the ability to learn from their tools and build new tools on the old.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to combine my programming experience with visual programming and
 creative web applications to make a framework for my own web experiments.
 I realized that I could make something with creative value to a wider audience
 by considering audiences for the framework other than myself -- programmers
 and non-programmers alike.
 Such a tool could invite people without coding experience to modify software
 tools and create their own.
 To this end, I have designed and created a web-based framework called Meemoo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objectives of this project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design a modular dataflow visual programming framework using web technologies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The framework should afford non-coders the ability to modify creative web
 apps by configuring wires that represent how modules communicate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There should be a simple syntax to define the inputs and outputs of a module.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Apps created with the framework should have source code that is easy to
 read and share.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Web developers should be able create new modules for the framework using
 a simple standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within this framework, an 
\emph on
app
\emph default
 is a collection of modules and the wires that connect them.
 A 
\emph on
module
\emph default
 is a web page that can live anywhere online, and use any web technology.
 This web page includes JavaScript that defines the module's inputs and
 outputs: what data is accepted, how the data is processed, and what kind
 of data will be sent.
 The 
\emph on
wires
\emph default
 define where each module sends data.
 The source code of the app that defines an its layout, routing, and state
 can be saved and shared with a small amount of text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo apps run in the web browser, so they will be able to run the same
 on PCs, smartphones, tablet computers, and soon TVs.
 Modifying and making new apps is done in the same browser interface, so
 no external developer tools are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo is programmed by connecting boxes with wires (Figure

So far I have focused module development on realtime animation tools, as
 this makes it simple to explain and engage creatively with the concept.
 It is not limited to animation though; any app or system that can be described
 by a dataflow graph can be made into a Meemoo app.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not start making Meemoo as an educational tool, but I have since been
 influenced by software projects inspired by Constructionist learning theory:
 Logo, Smalltalk, and Scratch.
 As I have read texts on Constructionism, I have seen many parallels to
 my own experiences as a learner.
 I think that Meemoo has the potential to be a good tool for learning by
 making.

Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo has many influences and precedents in the way that it has been designed,
 some direct and others indirect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the course of this thesis I will refer to 
\emph on
programming
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
coding
\emph default
 as distinct skills.
 Learning to program is a process of learning to manipulate logical structures.
 Learning to code puts those structures into a linear-textual format that
 computers can parse.
 Different programmable systems emphasize and abstract these aspects differently.
 I will also use the term 
\emph on
people
\emph default
 instead of 
\emph on
users
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
developers
\emph default
, as I would like to blur this distinction with the project.

hackability
\begin_inset Quotes erd

It might be a lost cause to try to reclaim this term from its common cultural
 understanding.

Designing for hackability implies respect.
 The designer of a hackable thing acknowledges that they cannot imagine
 every potential use, so they enable people to modify it to their will and
 connect it to other things.
 This quality can apply to software, physical artifacts, and services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For software to be hackable the source code should be available under a
 free license (see

 While this enables other people with coding skills to modify a software
 project, I would like to expand the affordances of software hackability
 to non-coders.

I saw the rise of touchscreen devices like the iPhone and iPad as a step
 backwards for participatory media.
 As originally marketed, these devices were designed primarily for media
 consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The only media production capabilities afforded by these devices was taking
 and sharing photos.
 When Apple later opened up the App Store they took a timid step towards
 hackability by allowing third party developers to create apps that extend
 the functionality of the device.
 I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

timid
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 because only developers that pay for the privilege can write apps for these
 devices, and only apps that pass an opaque curation process are allowed

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this closed ecosystem and technical limitations, the design of
 apps for iOS tend to have low to no hackability.
 In general, an app is designed to do one thing.
 The designer decides what the app does, how it communicates, where things
 can be shared.
 The

However, without an external keyboard, any kind of extended writing on touchscre

Putting all this together, we want an apparently free environment in which

 the magic is embedded in the familiar (Negroponte); and which acts as a
 magnifying mirror for the user's own intelligence (Coleridge).

I suggest that Kay and others aimed to create a particular kind of new media
 -- rather than merely simulating the appearances of old ones.
 These new media use already existing representational formats as their
 building blocks, while adding many new previously nonexistent properties.
 At the same time, as envisioned by Kay, these media are expandable -- that
 is, users themselves should be able to easily add new properties, as well
 as to invent new media.

 His editor shows the output of the code in real-time, without needing to
 change windows, compile, or save and refresh.
 Any number or color in the source code opens a slider or color picker,
 which immediately changes the visual output (Figure

 As somebody with experience coding visual applications in JavaScript, Flash,

 and refresh between changing code and seeing the result.

As computers became smaller and more common in classrooms, the signature
 Logo turtle was added to the system.
 This was a graphical representation of a turtle that would draw lines on
 the screen based on the instructions given by the child.
 For example,

 This small program draws a star (Figure

 By making the commands relative to the current position of the turtle,
 the language is easier to learn than a graphical drawing system based on

 Object-oriented programming splits code into logical classes that define
 the data for the object and the methods that access or modify that data.
 By splitting the code like this it becomes easier to organize and navigate
 more complex projects.

In tests some children programmed their own tools, like a twelve-year-old

 application.

\begin_layout Standard
Text-based programming languages have different requirements for syntax
 and indentation that if not followed perfectly will result in programs
 that do not run as expected (or at all).
 This can be frustrating for beginners and experienced coders alike -- most
 of my programming errors are missing semicolons or mismatched brackets.
 The creators of Scratch designed a coding system that works around syntax
 and the frustration of syntax errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scratch uses drag-and-drop 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

code blocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 instead of a text-based syntax, which makes coding less error-prone for
 beginners.
 These code blocks snap together only in ways that make syntactic sense
 (Figure

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Control structures (like 
\family typewriter

\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\family default
) are C-shaped to suggest that blocks should be placed inside them.
 Blocks that output values are shaped according to the types of values they
 return: ovals for numbers and hexagons for Booleans.
 Conditional blocks (like 
\family typewriter
if
\family default

\family typewriter
repeat-until
\family default
) have hexagon-shaped voids, indicating a Boolean is required.

Although creating a script with code blocks is more like snapping Legos

 The shape of the control structures is a direct metaphor to how code syntax
 works, and more visually obvious than brackets or indentation.

 I did not have this final output planned from the start.
 The available blocks influenced the direction of my exploration.
 For example, the last change was adding the drum sound when I saw that
 it was as easy as adding one more block to the script.
 Making something with comparable collision detection, color cycling, and
 audio triggering in Flash or Processing would have taken much longer.

 create something interesting.
 I look forward to playing with it more.

My motivation to make this project comes from years of experimenting with

 I have worked in different languages and environments, but the ability

 technologies.
 I make my experiments into online creative tools (web apps) in order to
 see how other people use my creations.
\end_layout

In a way, Meemoo is an abstraction of all of my earlier digital creative

My first memory of interacting with a computer was with an Apple Macintosh
 that my father brought home from work in the mid-1980s.
 I have a strong visual memory of using the mouse to connect numbered dots
 to draw a star.
 Once the star was complete it briefly became animated.
 Seeing this graphic, however simple, react to my input and then come alive
 captured my imagination.
 We only had that computer for a few days, but I was hooked.

Because of timing or school priorities, I was not part of the small generation
 of students that was exposed to BASIC or LOGO programming in school.
 I remained interested in computers, spending any time that I could get
 my hands on them on shareware games and paint programs.
 I did not get into programming until high school, in two very different
 ways: Texas Instruments graphing calculators and web programming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My higher-level math classes used TI-8x series of graphing calculators.
 These have the ability to write and run programs with a BASIC-like syntax.
 My first program mirrored a game played by many children on standard calculator
s: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+1 game.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This game is played by pressing the buttons [1] [+] [1] [=], and then pressing
 [=] as fast as possible.
 This makes the calculator into a counter, and we would have races to see
 who could press [=] fastest.
 Pressing buttons seems to be a common interest for children.
 When a system reacts to the button press, it gives the child a sense of
 control.
 The program that I wrote was just a few lines of code.
 It counted from zero, adding one and displaying the result in an infinite
 loop as fast as the calculator could go.
 I had automated the +1 game, taking out the button-pressing dynamic.
 It was satisfying to see the numbers flying by on the screen.
 I then made a new version of the script that printed the Fibonacci sequence
 in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then figured out how to script complicated graphic drawings on the small
 monochromatic screen.
 I would watch with interest as the calculator slowly rendered patterns
 from my scripts, one stroke at a time.
 This was my first experience with programming graphics.
 I never managed to make a program draw what I originally had in mind, but
 this was not discouraging.
 The serendipitous images that emerged from my experiments encouraged me
 to explore different directions, and create new challenges for myself.
 I learned a lot about cartesian geometry, algebra, and logic from these
 code explorations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scripting environment on these calculators gave them hackability.
 This afforded my creative exploration of math and graphical programming.

The availability of the Internet in my home spurred the second programming
 interest.
 It was empowering to publish my first web site.
 It was a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where I could freely express myself in many different ways.
 Anybody in the world could see it, through the same window and at the same
 size and resolution as the websites of corporations, governments, and universit
ies.
 Learning how to create and post webpages gave me a level of active participatio
n that other media had not offered me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I learned web programming by example, mostly thanks to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 command on the browser.
 I would take a little bit of code from a tutorial, some code from another
 page's source, and tinker and experiment with the combination in an editor
 that showed both the code and output in the same window.
 These web programming experiments continued from this time and have culminated
 in this thesis project.

This project is the direct ancestor of Meemoo.
 I wanted to create a remixer for web video, including Youtube.
 The interface was split between controller and player, which were in separate
 HTML pages to allow the player page to be put on a separate monitor or
 projector.
 The controller page sent trigger signals as text to the player page using
 the same mechanism as the current Meemoo uses to send data from module
 to module.
 In early 2011 this mechanism,

 Around the middle of the year this limitation was lifted, allowing arbitrary

There were several types of controllers that could be used to remix the
 video.
 Each video had triggers that corresponded to the keys of the keyboard.
 Patterns could be made by typing these trigger keys.
 Then the patterns could be put in order in the sequencer.
 It is a complex system, and I never got around to actually using it.
 This is a pitfall of tool design that I would like to avoid in the future.
 Making these different kinds of music pattern sequencers into reconfigurable
 Meemoo modules will allow for more flexible tool design.

I have experience with two dataflow visual programming environments: Quartz
 Composer and Pure Data.
 The feeling of direct manipulation and immediate feedback in working with
 these environments appealed to me.
 I was able to do graphics and audio processing with them that I could not
 do with any text-based coding environment, so I was able to explore new
 kinds of audio/visual experiments.
 They are great tools for interactive installations, when you have control
 over the system.
 However, it is impossible to use them for creating web apps.

In order to design Meemoo for open modular hackability it must be easy for

 Meemoo modules are simple web pages that can be hosted anywhere.
 A module is referenced by its web address and loaded into the framework
 in an iframe.
 The framework surrounds the iframe with a resizable window with inputs

Usability design for hackability

\begin_layout Standard
The wiring view might be intimidating to some people at first glance.
 This is a tradeoff that every design makes, balancing simplicity and power.
 It is my hope that the simplicity of what is inside the modules will encourage
 people to explore the power in the framework.
 This is called a layered or spiral approach to learning, where success
 with one level encourages exploration in the next

Direct manipulation

\begin_layout Standard
One design difference between Meemoo and Quartz Composer is that Meemoo
 is able to have interface elements within each module.
 By way of example, an image filter module shows what it does to the image
 every time it receives image data (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Glitch-app"

\end_inset

).
 This should make it easier for people to understand how data flows through
 the application.

\begin_layout Subsection
What is abstracted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Meemoo framework is a level of abstraction built on several levels of
 abstraction: JavaScript, browser, operating system, computer hardware.
 Modules can be made that do one programmatic function, which will lead
 to more apps with more modules and wires to build the logical functions
 required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My preference is to abstract away more logic in the JavaScript of the module.
 This makes each module a small self-contained application, like the paint
 module in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Meemoo-screen-shot"

\end_inset

.
 I could have made the color picker from the paint application its own module.
 The framework dictates no preference to how much is abstracted into each
 module.

Graphic design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pure Data has a quirky charm once you get over the initial steep learning
 curve, but some percentage of the charm is in being the only person on
 earth able to understand your own tangle of monochrome wires.
 One graphic design motivation was to make something nicer to look at and
 easier to understand at first glance than Pure Data.

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to talk as little as possible, to see how people would interact
 with the framework if they had found it on their own.
 I reminded each person that I was not testing them, we were testing the
 usability of the project.
 I tested some people with no programming experience, and some people of
 varying experience with coding and visual programming.
 There were some usability issues that became quite obvious:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An introduction to the framework would be helpful to introduce the basic
 concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I left the design of the modules plain to focus on the design of the framework.
 This seemed to make some people miss the buttons within the modules, and
 start by moving wires around.
 I will need to make the inside of the modules the primary focus so that
 people don't unwire the apps before they understand what they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modules can specify the kind of data that ports send and accept.
 I could implement something like the shaped variables from Scratch's codeblocks
 to make it more obvious which ports can be wired together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Connecting wires by drag and drop was easy for all levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disconnecting wires is currently done by a less direct method that proved
 much less intuitive.
 First the port must be clicked to show the port information popup in which
 there is a button with a scissor icon to disconnect the wire (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Port-information"

\end_inset

).
 It was implemented this way as a temporary solution, and should be replaced
 with a direct method, more like pulling the wire out of the port.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is an indirect method to connect wires.
 The button for that also got in the way.
 The spacing between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button and and the title of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 section made people put those items together.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a method to input a value directly into the port from the port
 information popup.
 The submit function is a check-mark, which was overlooked by almost everybody.
 They tended instead to click on the button that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A large part of the development of Meemoo was creating apps with the framework.
 While creating apps, I think of processes that would have general purpose

 Adding these modules to the library gives more ideas about the kinds of
 apps that can be made.

I had been imagining a system for online tipping that would make it possible
 for people to defer a certain percentage of a donation to any number of
 other people.
 For example, a film collective makes their work freely available on Pirate
 Bay.
 I download the film, enjoy it, and decide to give them a tip to show my
 appreciation.
 I see a tip widget on their website that explains that 10% of tips are
 deferred to each of three actors, 5% to a band on the soundtrack, etc.
 I send them $10, and the tip system divides and distributes the tip automatical
ly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These networks of tips could get quite complicated.
 The band's tips could be deferred to the band members.
 There could be two people that defer tips to each other.

 To make this simulation I wrote a Meemoo module that, when a number is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This application shows a nice feature of modular design.
 Each node in the graph is the same HTML module with different settings.
 This illustrates the object-oriented nature of the Meemoo framework, with
 modules that are like individual computers in a network that communicate
 with messages

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By making this model interactive software people can experiment with the
 system and see how tips to different nodes in the system get distributed.
 The model is built on Meemoo, so it is inherently hackable.
 If somebody disagrees with the model -- or has a similar idea -- they could
 fork the project and modify how it works to illustrate their point.
 This is an exciting possibility.

Partially thanks to this provocation, I decided to find a venue to perform

 I was invited to VJ at Zodiak's Side-Step dance festival club night on

 I used the gig as an opportunity to push Meemoo development and pressure-test
 the live-animation features.
 
\end_layout

For the gig I made some special modules for creating a "world" into which

 On the software development side, I am happy that I decided to make two
 modules (Controller and World, Figure

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few improvements and ideas that became clear in the course of
 the evening:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Camera: I used a Sony Eyetoy webcam, which had unsatisfactory color reproduction.
 I chose art supplies with rich colors, but most of the color was washed
 out in the first step.
 Next time I will do some tests to find a better camera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Audience participation: I planned to use Kinect to get silhouettes of people
 dancing into the world, but ran out of time.
 I was imagining using different animated textures for specified depth ranges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Flocking: I only had time to implement the tiled animation.
 The original concept was that sprites could be individual or flocks that
 would move around the screens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UX tweaks: Confirm dialog on every delete got annoying when juggling around
 modules.
 It would be better if there were an undo function, so delete could work
 without confirmation.
 A method for un/replugging wires that is more direct would make it quicker
 and easier to change the workings of the app.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I made a hack to open the World module in a new window to view it fullscreen
 on the projectors.
 I plan on making this a built-in feature for any module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these limitations, I got a lot of good feedback about the visuals.
 People were interested in what I was doing, and came around to play with
 the art supplies.
 Doing dance party visuals powered by a web browser was a fun experiment,
 and with a few more display options I think that the limitations would
 have been less aesthetically obvious.
 Performing under pressure was a good way to test the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Section
Community for sharing apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo was designed for sharing.
 I would like to take elements of an App Store, Reddit, and Github to create
 a community for sharing and forking Meemoo apps.
 Because of the small amount of source code to describe a Meemoo app (Algorithm
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Touchscreen support

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo has the potential to become a powerful tool for creative programming
 on touchscreen devices.
 The library of modules reduces the need to write code in a text editor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gestures for zooming and panning are common in touchscreen interaction,
 and could be an intuitive way of navigating a Meemoo application.
 Since Meemoo runs in the browser, zooming and panning already work smoothly.
 Module dragging and wire connecting will take some more development time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo runs in browser, and in general JavaScript is slower than native
 code.
 However, as the power of these devices increases, the kinds of apps that
 can be built with Meemoo will likewise increase.

\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "jsFiddle.net"
target "http://jsfiddle.net/"

\end_inset

 are designed to streamline the experience of editing and sharing HTML experimen
ts and examples.
 The first screen of the site presents three text areas for HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript, and a result frame that runs the web page output (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:jsFiddle"

\end_inset

).
 This site is used by JavaScript library developers to demonstrate bugs,
 as well as to make demonstrations for web programming questions and answers
 in forums such as StackOverflow.
 The immediacy of editing, saving, running, and sharing code in the browser
 makes this a time-saving tool for these communities.

I have been developing the first Meemoo modules using a traditional desktop
 code editor.
 I am used to switching between code editor and browser to test changes,
 and I probably make this mode switch hundreds of times per day.
 A code editor similar to jsFiddle that runs within Meemoo would eliminate
 the need to constantly switch applications to develop and test modules.
 Pressing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

view source
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a module would open an editor showing the source code of the module.
 From this view, there would be options to edit the current module (if you
 have access to it) or fork the module into a new one.

The open-source programming environment DesignBlocksJS (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) uses Scratch's codeblock programming metaphor.
 Combining these concepts, you could have the higher-level wiring hackability
 of Meemoo, and the lower-level coding hackability of codeblocks to edit
 the source of a Meemoo module.
 Programming modules with codeblocks would be a good transitional step between

On touchscreens, coding with drag-and-drop codeblocks has the potential
 to be much easier than text-based coding.
 Some optimization would be required to account for the difference in mouse

These examples show how -- in the same way that the Internet encompasses
 all past and future media -- a hackable creative coding environment that
 runs in the browser can encompass and interact with all other creative
 coding environments.
 The educational philosophies that developed these systems can be hacked,
 updated, and incorporated into new educational goals.
